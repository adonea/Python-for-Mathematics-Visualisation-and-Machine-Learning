This is a beginner to intermediate  course on Python for Maths lovers. It will have optimisation, algorithms, data access, statistics, visualization, coding, machine learning algorithms. 

I am always learning about Python, IDL, Mathematica, Unix Scripts, C, Fortran and I find it fascinating, especially that 
there are so many modules, libraries that can do our work and we don't have to re-invent the wheel.

 I will work with you to get you started with intermediate Python and mainly, to help you understand many options that Python  may offer for  your own research.

Python is a high-level, interpreted and general-purpose dynamic programming language that focuses on code readability. The syntax in Python helps the programmers 
to  code in fewer steps as compared to Java or C++. The language founded in the year 1991 by the developer Guido Van Rossum has the programming easy and 
fun to do.  Python is widely used in bigger organizations because of its multiple programming paradigms. They usually involve imperative and object-oriented 
functional programming. It has a comprehensive and large standard library that has automatic memory management and dynamic features.hexbin_demo

"The practice of data science requires the use of analytics tools, technologies and languages to help data professionals extract insights and value from data. A recent survey by Kaggle revealed that data professionals relied on Python, R and SQL more than other tools in 2017. Looking ahead to 2018, the survey results showed that data professionals are most interested in learning Tensorflow, Python and R:

I supervise  PhD students on the field of astrophysics and modelling of MHDs and recently  on machine learning and solar physics. 
I like teaching astrophysics, Advanced Engineering Mathematics, Calculus, Mathematical Modelling, Visualization and  Data Analysis, 
Satellite Imaging and soon ...I have just managed to run a big algorithms on  machine learning and pattern recognition for the sunspots 
on the Sun using deep learning GAN algorithm.

For a  PhD student, research and publishing is the key to success. Writing a PhD thesis, presenting your results is also part of the game. 
Writing grant applications is essential at one stage in your career, and techniques of visualisation matter! Research today has to be done 
original, so coding  for visualisation, interpretation and presenting results is an essential key.

Also, coding skills and visualisation of results increase your chance to get a good job!

The Motto of our sessions is : Go Interactive!

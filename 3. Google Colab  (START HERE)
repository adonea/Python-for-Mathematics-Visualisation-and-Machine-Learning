You will work on Google Collab or if you prefer you can work with  python on your own machine.

Colaboratory is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud.
With Colaboratory you can write and execute code, save and share your analyses, and access powerful computing resources, all for free from your browser.

For info about Google Colab: https://youtu.be/inN8seMm7UI

Instructions:

Go to colab.google (if you have a google account this will be very easy)
Open a notebook. Rename it First_code.ipynb

Try this:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x  = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
y1 = [1, 3, 5, 3, 1, 3, 5, 3, 1]
y2 = [2, 4, 6, 4, 2, 4, 6, 4, 2]
plt.plot(x, y1, label="line L")
plt.plot(x, y2, label="line H")
plt.plot()

plt.xlabel("x axis")
plt.ylabel("y axis")
plt.title("Line Graph Example")
plt.legend()
plt.show()

Try also this:

x1 = [2, 3, 4]
y1 = [5, 5, 5]

x2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y2 = [2, 3, 2, 3, 4]
y3 = [6, 8, 7, 8, 7]

# Markers: https://matplotlib.org/api/markers_api.html

plt.scatter(x1, y1)
plt.scatter(x2, y2, marker='v', color='r')
plt.scatter(x2, y3, marker='^', color='m')
plt.title('Scatter Plot Example')
plt.show()

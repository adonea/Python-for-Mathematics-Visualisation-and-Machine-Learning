We will focus on the Jupyter notebooks during our workshop.

Start with Workshop 1.1, then if you are advanced proceed to 1.2 (More plots) and 1.3 (Ordinary differential Equations, for those interested)

The small codes can be run independently of the Jupyter notebook in any Python Environment. They are designed for beginners,
I had these in my folder for a long time.

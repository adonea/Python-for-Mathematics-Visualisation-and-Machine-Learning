:+1: Meeting point: 
Room G60 School of Mathematics

:+1: Bring your own laptop

:+1: We will work with jupyter notebooks on Google Collabs. If you prefer to work on your own python environment on your laptop, this is ok too. 


:+1: Important sites:
- [ ] Submit Fully worked Notebooks and the final assignment to the shared folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17381sXBaUOEdizBhrD5VO5gZUkpCiTev?usp=drive_link . Please create a folder with your name (Example: Alina_Donea_Monday) in the corresponding folder.

#Reading CSV Files Into a Dictionary With csv
#Rather than deal with a list of individual String elements, you can read CSV data directly into a dictionary (technically, an Ordered Dictionary) as well.

#Again, our input file, employee_birthday.txt is as follows:

import csv

with open('example1.txt', mode='r') as csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file)
    line_count = 0
    for row in csv_reader:
        if line_count == 0:
            print(f'Column names are {", ".join(row)}')
            line_count += 1
        print(f'\t{row["name"]} works in the {row["department"]} department, and was born in {row["birthday month"]}.')
        line_count += 1
    print(f'Processed {line_count} lines.')


#Writing CSV Files With csv
#You can also write to a CSV file using a writer object and the .write_row() method:

import csv

with open('employee_file.csv', mode='w') as employee_file:
    employee_writer = csv.writer(employee_file, delimiter=',', quotechar='"', quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL)

    employee_writer.writerow(['John Smith', 'Accounting', 'November'])
    employee_writer.writerow(['Erica Meyers', 'IT', 'March'])
